# Embracing the kata

I really like how node opens up the possibilities to create single-page, real-time apps that can share information between users.

I also like playing with rspec-like jasmine while working through samples with node and developing node apps via tdd.  I did that with nodebeginner.org samples. 

The result is what you see here - 

* nodebeginner.org samples generted with increasing complexity
* coffeescript samples because I just use it
* jasmine specs to help define how to best test a node app
* ...
* profit
